# TubeAir

A raster dataset for modelling exposure to PM2.5 while on the London Underground. The data was collected over 2016 and 2017, the processed to create a raster dataset with each layer of the raster corresponding to a different London underground line. In this way routing APIs and algorithms can return routes between locations, and then intersect these spatial lines or points with the raster layer appropriately.
